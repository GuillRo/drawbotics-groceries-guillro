A dropdown menu allows to display the different lists. 'All' display all items in every lists.

Lists and items can be added by typing their name in the corresponding input.

Adding an item to the 'All' list will create a new "Misc" list.

Right-clicking on an item or on a list (in the list dropdown menu) will delete the list or item.
